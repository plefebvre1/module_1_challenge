Repository for Module 1 Challenge

You work for a lending startup engaged in microcredit loans. The company needs help valuing these loans. In this Challenge, you'll automate a process that does just that.

Youâ€™ll create a Python program that automates the tasks associated with valuing microlending loans. Specifically, you'll do the following:

1) Create a GitHub Repository
2) Automate the Calculations
3) Analyze Loan Data
4) Perform Financial Calculations
5) Conditionally Filter Lists of Loans
6) Save the Results

You'll then upload your final code to GitHub.
